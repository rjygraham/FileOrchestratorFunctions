# FileOrchestratorFunctions

Sample Durable Azure Function to illustrate how to delay batch processing until all required events have been received.

## Setup

1. Create new Azure Function App in Azure.
1. Create Blob container named `input` in the Storage Account created with your Azure Function App.
1. Add the following Configuration Settings to the Azure Function App:
    - "RequiredEvents": "fileAcomplete,fileB,fileC"
    - "BlobIgnoreFiles": "fileA"
1. Deploy this Function App code to the new Azure Function App you just created in Azure.

## Usage

1. Create empty text files with the file names in the format of (feel free to create multiple sets to simulate multiple overlapping jobs):

````
YYYYMMDD##-fileA.txt
YYYYMMDD##-fileB.txt
YYYYMMDD##-fileC.txt
````

2. Get the Function URL of the `HandleHttpEventAsync`, it should be in the format of:

````
https://<functionname>.azurewebsites.net/api/files/{instanceId}/{eventName}?code=<function authorization code>
````

3. Connect to the Log Stream of the Azure Function App and then upload the `YYYYMMDD##-fileA.txt` file to the `input` blob container. You should see the following logs appear in the log stream (there will be quite a few... so you'll have to look closely):

````
Received event fileA for YYYYMMDD##.
Ignoring fileA for YYYYMMDD##.
````

4. Now upload `YYYYMMDD##-fileB.txt` file to the `input` container and observe the following logs:

````
Received event fileB for YYYYMMDD##.
Processing fileB for YYYYMMDD##.
Event fileB is the first event received for YYYYMMDD##. Starting new orchestration.
Raising fileB for YYYYMMDD##.
````

5. Next upload `YYYYMMDD##-fileC.txt` file to the `input` container and observe the following logs:

````
Received event fileC for YYYYMMDD##.
Processing fileC for YYYYMMDD##.
Raising fileC for YYYYMMDD##.
````

6. Finally, use cURL, Postman, Fiddler, VS Code REST Client to send a POST to the `HandleHttpEventAsync` Function URL you retrieved above. The URL should look like:

````
https://<functionname>.azurewebsites.net/api/files/YYYYMMDD##/fileAcomplete?code=<function authorization code>
````

After you received HTTP 200 response, observe the following logs:

````
Received event fileAcomplete for YYYYMMDD##.
Raising fileAcomplete for YYYYMMDD##.
Beginning to process job for YYYYMMDD##!
````

Experiment with sending events out of order and changing the values of the `RequiredEvents` and `BlobIgnoreFiles` configuration values of the Azure Function App.
